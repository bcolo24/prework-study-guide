# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide Webpage is a useful reference for the work I have completed throughout the Prework. I created this webpage to have a place for all of my notes from the modules, while also putting those skills to use. I now have a webpage that I could go back to and read the key points about each program, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and GitHub. To have created this page, I needed to become familiar with and practice using each of those programs or languages. I also wanted to create this webpage because I am going to begin Coding Bootcamp and I did not want to start the course without knowing the basic skills I would need to be successful. This Webpage solved that issue because I am now equipped with those skills. It also gave me a great online study tool. As I could continue the course, I can add more information to the notes section as a place to organize my work. I learned how to create a basic webpage using JavaScript, HTML, GitHub, and CSS.

Functions of this Webpage include being an organization tool for my notes. Each program or language is catagorized by its title, being JavaScript, GitHub, HTML, and CSS. Also, when Chrome DevTools is opened and we inspect the page, we can see JavaScript being used. Additionally, in the console tab of DevTools, the site can choose a random topic for the user to study.
